Lateefah Simon,simon.jpg,7,,No,"I live in Oakland and am not a member of the San Francisco Transit Riders Union, though I should be considering how often I use transit to get to my hometown of San Francisco!",daily,"Everyday. I am legally blind and have never driven a car, so my entire life I have been dependent on public transportation in the Bay Area. ","to get to work, take her daughter to school, run errands, visit friends/family, get everywhere she needs to go in the Bay Area","I ride transit to get to work, take my daughter to school, run errands, visit friends and family, and get everywhere I need to go in the Bay Area","I always choose transit over other modes of transportation, unless there is no transit option in which case I will use Lyft. ","Public transit is integral to the everyday lived experiences of working people, seniors, students, people with disabilities, and other transit-dependent people. Poor transit options actually impact the daily lives of millions of people in the Bay Area, whether a delayed train means they can't get to work on time or a broken elevator means they can't get anywhere at all on BART. Increasingly, as the affordability crisis pushes folks farther out, families are dependent on public transportation to stay connected to the center of their cultural and familial centers. To me, the BART Board is about more than trains and tracks &mdash; it's about social and economic equity. ","As transit leaders, we should strive to constantly increase the percentage of transit riders. If we deeply invest in our transportation systems to make them clean, accessible, and reliable, more folks will use transit. If we prioritize affordability of transit, more folks will use transit. In other places, active investment and social movement have created communities that thrive on transit. We should look to examples around the world to bring world-class transportation systems to the Bay Area.","I have dedicated my career to fighting for communities of color and low-income communities, and I will continue to do so on the BART Board. I believe that BART can do better to serve these communities by making fares more affordable to students and low-income families. Funding is never an easy question, but I will work tirelessly with government, business, communities, and transit professionals to come up with creative solutions to fund fare discount programs like we did with free MUNI for youth and the SFSU/BART partnership. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,I would use my long experience as a community organizer to uplift issues of transportation and organize the community to support these solutions. Transit riders need a powerful voice to fight for their interestes and I intend to be that voice. ,,,"My ideal vision for transportation in the Bay Area is one that is accountable, accessible, and affordable. You can read my plan for BART at<br/><br/>www.lateefahforbart.com/issues.","Funding BART's capital needs will require overcoming a funding shortfall of over $12 billion dollars over the next 25 years to just to get BART back to a state of good repair. Capital needs increase when we consider expanding and modernizing BART. In comparison, BART's annual operating budget is $1.8 billion. There's no way we could overcome our capital funding needs through saving on operations costs alone.<br/><br/>As BART Director, I would work with our elected leaders in Sacramento and Washington, D.C. to bring more state and federal transportation dollars to the Bay Area. I would be in favor of local transportation funding measures, and believe that these funds can be most effectively allocated among transit operators when there is a clear and well-communicated regional plan, implemented by operators working together. Also, I believe we can do more to get large corporations to help pay for the systems that transport their workers everyday.<br/><br/>BART has obligations to its riders to provide safe, well-maintained service, and also to invest in the long term sustainability of BART. Replacing 90 miles of track, renewing the power infrastructure, repairing tunnels and structures, and upgrading the control panel are essential to keeping BART working for the people who depend on it. Likewise, making investments now for the future of BART, including advancing the planning for a second Transbay Tube, will be essential to ensuring that BART works for the people who depend on it for the decades to come.","Yes, I have endorsed both Props J & K. My endorsement is listed on yesonjandk.com.",Yes,Yes,"As the only candidate who is transit-dependent and who refuses to take campaign contributions from contractors, my commitment to delivering accountable, accessible, and affordable transit to riders is unwavering.

I am always hearing the horror stories from my friends who still commute into the city.",to go into the city or to bring packages home from work,When I go into the city or to bring packages home from work., See #3.,Public transit is a very important aspect of the bay area. It cuts pollution and most times is more economical than driving. Unfortunately we have some of the least efficient transit systems in the country.,"By making the systems more efficient; I believe that many people don't take transit because of delays, over-crowding and dirty, aging equipment. Make transit easier, more affordable and cleaner.",BART fares need to be addressed. SF is lucky to have the MUNI/BART pass available. The same kind of pass needs to be developed for the whole BART system including regional bus systems and more and better parking at outlying stations.,No,No. Until BART can prove it will use the money for upkeep there should be no more parcel taxes. It's throwing good money after bad.,Yes,Yes. There should be at least trains every hour or so and possibly limited stops but we are a world class area with little or no 24 hour access.,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes. Something must be done to relive the bottle neck in Oakland and a second line would do that. And when building the second tube put all the lines underground in  West Oakland. It would also give the system redundancy in a major earthquake.,,,,"There are some easy fixes I would propose: Follow CalTrain and provide the last car as bike only thus helping to avoid overcrowding at peak hours and making it easier for bicyclists to enter and exit cars.  Make some cars standing only for those that do not mind standing or are going shorter distances.<br/><br/> Re-open public restrooms in all stations and change them from single use to real public restrooms. Make sure they are clean and staffed.<br/><br/>Repair fare gates and add more handicapped gates.<br/><br/>Develop regional fare passes to save riders money and time and/or make a real high value savings card. Saving $4 is ridiculous.<br/><br/>Clean the stations and bring back garbage cans. It's stupid that there is nowhere to discard trash items.<br/><br/>Make sure all cars have working doors and air-conditioning.<br/><br/>BART police should not be armed. Train them with batons and possibly Tasers. Local law enforcement officers should handle all dangerous situations.<br/><br/>Surveillance cameras should be working and monitored at all times.<br/><br/>Wi-Fi should be free and available at all times and will act as a crime deterrent.<br/><br/>BART trains should run 24 hours a day even if late night is limited stops and trains every hour, there needs to be 24 hour service.","All growth should be put on hold until the core system and especially the bottle neck in Oakland is taken care of. A new tube or rail bridge needs to be a priority (hopefully it would include a Treasure Island stop). We need the redundancy in case of a natural disaster and this would allow for more capacity in the system. Stop expansion, build more and better parking and focus all money on the core system.","No, I have not.",No Stance,No Stance,"There are some simple, easy fixes that BART could implement that would make riding less of a chore and then there are systemic problems with BART management and planning that need to be completely overhauled, proactive maintenance being an important one.

Will Roscoe,roscoe.jpg,7,,No,,daily,More than 10 times per week,for commuting and attending events,Commuting and attending events.,I use transit when it will save me 15 minutes when compared to walking or biking. I don't own a car.,"I think public transit should be focused on organizing, creating and regulating mass transit infrastructure. This is in contrast to the current operations focus of most agencies (MUNI, BART, AC TRANSIT ). ","Ideally 100 percent of people would use mass transit every week. The best way to expand ridership is to provide better service. This means more affordable, convenient and comfortable service. ","Service areas/routes should be determined by demand via online voting. Public transit should be offered where people will use it most.<br/><br/>Public transit should be FREE for people who are: <ul><li>younger than 18 years old</li><li>older than 65 years old</li><li>a current student</li><li>low income (has Medicare card)</li></ul> <br/>These costs should be paid by the state or nation rather than the agency.",No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No. I support another crossing but not if it's exclusively rail. Rail is becoming increasingly uncompetitive and would be a poor technology to commit to for the trans bay crossing.,"Just like the original funding of the BART system, I'd share the vision of how amazing a modern transit system would be. If a transit system is good enough, the president will come just to take a ride. People want to be proud of their city and the transit system can be a part of that pride. ","Measure RR commits BART to pursue a direction that will make it uncompetitive with self driving buses in 10 years. I believe that BART should have a plan to build an awesome transit system before the public gifts them billions of dollars. Measure RR sets a new low bar for our expectations of transit. Essentially, BART is campaigning for the measure with the promise to spend more than $10 billion and 20 years to maintain the existing system. This level of improvement and innovation will create a system that is unable to compete on cost and convenience with self driving buses being developed today. ",Installing rail transit is like hardwiring a computer program. If their is any mistake or change needed its very expensive to fix. We'll be better off as a region if we start divesting from our custom and expensive rail infrastructure and begin investing dedicated high throughput self driving right of ways. The cost per passenger mile economics will make this obvious in a couple years. ,"A transit rider opens their phone, enters their destination and sees the closest transit stops to get there. They never have to wait more than 5 minutes. The bus that picks them up has desks, seats, internet, and is a quiet and smooth ride. Riders choose transit because its cheaper and more convenient than driving a personal car. <br/><br/>To make this happen, the transit agencies need to start building infrastructure that they can share (ie. not BART's custom gauge rail) like unobstructed roads and bus stops. The agencies also need to embraced and push the limits of self driving technology so that they can compete on cost in the next decade. They need to welcome competition from private operators and rent their infrastructure (ie bus stops) to them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>If elected I'll work to push the BART leadership in this direction to plan for how BART infrastructure could be used by other operators. If not elected I'll likely work to organize private and public transit operators to build / lobby for this common and shared transit infrastructure. ",First the agency should be expected to have fares (assuming discounted passes are sold at full price) pay for operations and maintenance. Currently the expectation is that public transit can always ask taxpayers to pay for overruns and this puts transit in a desperate position (see measure rr ).<br/><br/>Expansion should be the only thing loans or bonds should be used for. ,,No,No,"Everyone, especially ""urbanists"", need to get over this obsession with rail. Rail is a stagnant and centrally controlled technology that prevents transit systems from adapting to changing demands. Stop making false comparisons between trains with a dedicated right of way and buses on crowded urban streets. Compare transit technologies apples to apples so can make a fair comparison before committing billions of dollars to technology that is decades outdated. This mindset of many transit advocates and agencies to build rail at all costs will assure the demise of public transit and give private transit operators huge leverage in the next 2 decades. "

It can happen!","I spent the first 14 years of my political/public service career working on Capitol Hill to secure funding (starting in 1979) to build the LA Metro system of heavy and light rail and commuter rail. Four of those years I worked for the LA Metro agency, so this is my passion and I'm proud of what I accomplished.<br/><br/>My Boss was Neil Peterson who is recognized as a visionary transit leader. He provided a quote about my work:<br/><br/>&quot;Bevan Dufty, while serving as Federal Relations Chief of the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, was instrumental in bringing more Federal grants to Los Angeles than any other city in the country to what at the time was the largest transit public works project in the nation &mdash; building the rail system in Southern California.  Without his experience of having worked on Capitol Hill and his diligent work ethic Southern California would not have today 464 miles of rail service and the 105 million boardings each year.<br/><br/>In addition, Bevan served as Chief of Staff to the CEO of LACTC and in that role was able to be involved in and exposed to all the issues that transit agencies face in a major metropolitan area.  He is extremely knowledgeable about what the issues are, and more importantly, what it takes to get resolution to difficult issues.  He is unbelievably well qualified.&quot;<br/><br/>As a BART Director I intend to utilize all my skills and relationships working at the federal level to secure infrastructure and other funding to reinvest and improve BART.","Yes, I support J and K to support transit, new BART cars and improved services, such as the Navigation Centers that I championed to help homeless people.

Gwyneth Borden,borden.jpg,9,,Yes,,daily,Daily,for work and getting around,Work and getting around.,"The only time I don't take transit (which for me means taxis or rideshare since I don't own a car) is when I'm running late, have to make a trip that would take too long on transit (like going from Bernal Heights to the Presidio) or it's late at night and I'm tired. I also make trips on bike and foot of course!","Public transportation is a core part of the San Francisco Bay Area's infrastructure. San Francisco has been the region's jobs center because of its transit accessibility and livable neighborhoods. Public transit is the difference in whether people of all socio-economic levels can participate in the job market. And we know our region will continue to grow, so it's vital to have a strong public transit network for livability. We cannot build new roads nor accommodate more people and their cars. The only way our region can sustain and grow and remain livable is through a strong, multimodal public transportation network that allows people to get around at all times of day for all their needs.","I would love to see those numbers be more like 75% rides transit in San Francisco and more than 50% for the Bay Area, recognizing the transit infrastructure varies throughout the Bay Area. I know these are extremely aggressive goals given that even in New York where there's a great subway system, only about 60% rides transit. However, given our mild weather and the amount of transit options available in neighborhood corridors and downtown, this is totally attainable &mdash; in like 50 years:) <br/><br/>Growing transit ridership and access requires improving transit speed and reliability and having affordable transportation options that can accommodate those with disabilities or impairments. Public transportation must be multimodal and provide a variety of options &mdash; bikes, shuttles, taxis, etc. &mdash; as well as real-time information about how to access the network of options so people are informed about their best option for making a trip.  ","It is important that any transit agency have equity as part of its strategic plan and even dedicate money in the budget toward equity.  Equity requires having key stakeholders that represent diverse communities represented on transit boards and committees. It also requires detailed, multilingual outreach plans to reach communities most transit dependent where they are, and collect key data on travel patterns, mode usage, time spent on transit for various trips, etc., to examine how to best provide transit options that work and will be used. And ensure any programs devised will reach those intended to be served. Through making real the equity analysis approach from MTC's Plan Bay Area a priority in funding and all transit decisions, we can maintain a commitment to equity, affordability and access for all. ",Yes,"Yes, enthusiastically!",Yes,Yes. That's why we need RR to pass so we can make it happen!,Yes,"Yes. The easier that we can make it for people to take different transit options, the more likely people will do it. I currently take the Muni to BART pretty much daily. ",Yes,"Yes, please!","(I'm assuming you're referring to the 2nd crossing question before.) It's important to engage neighbors and business owners to understand whether there is alignment in vision and work to see if there are common goals that can be achieved. I'm a fan of the charette process for community engagement. I do think collecting and providing data on transit patterns and growth projections is an important part of the process. Ultimately, when planning the second transbay tube, the priority has to be locating the tube where density exists and is anticipated and those communities who want the tube have to agree to that vision if they want the project.<br/><br/>I would personally go to community group meetings to do the necessary outreach to communities as a first step in the process to see where there's alignment related to the second transbay tube, and understand the BART priorities of San Franciscans.  There's interest in BART to the beach, a 30th Street BART station and more, so there's a need to agree on the transbay tube as being a top priority.  I would also look to work with groups like SPUR that have already done thinking in this area to engage stakeholders, and have BART participate in this process.",,,"My ideal vision for transportation in the San Francisco Bay Area is a seamless network where with one pass or a cell phone, anyone could complete a trip using a variety of modes anywhere in the Bay Area. I also envision a system that has fare equity where riders who can least afford it don't have to pay a disproportionate amount of their income on public transportation. My first step will be working to see if we could get a joint taskforce together for the three BART District counties &mdash; Alameda, Contra Costa and San Francisco to work on better coordination, a more seamless network and cost equity issues. The goal will be to work on fare equity and alignment with other transit partners as well as explore this whether something could be piloted. ","I will work to ensure that BART is pursuing all state and federal funding opportunities ranging from grants to cap and trade funds. I would also look for public/private opportunities to support the system &mdash; there are opportunities ranging from technology partnerships to direct funding opportunities. Since capital money is easier to come by from outside sources, it's important that fares be focused on operations. Given there are capital needs like new trains and other equipment, some money needs to be allocated for capital. However, the priority for funds must be on maintaining operations.
